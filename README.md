## Overview

The `mlts` package allows fitting multilevel manifest or latent time
series models and dynamic structural equation models (DSEM), as
described in Asparouhov et al. (2018). It relies on
[Stan](https://mc-stan.org) (Stan Development Team, 2023b) and the
`rstan` package (Stan Development Team, 2023a) for Bayesian inference.
The package is designed for researchers working with intensive
longitudinal data, e.g., data from ambulatory assessment studies or
experience sampling methods. Models allow for missing data, unequal
numbers of observations across units, unequally spaced observations, and
approximation of continuous time processes. Parameters can be subjected
to restrictions (i.e., fixations or equality constraints) and latent
variables can be incorporated using a measurement model. For the models
hypothesized by the user, a LaTex formula and path models can be
inspected, and model parameters can be plotted.

## Installation

The most recent `mlts` release can be installed from CRAN via

``` r
install.packages("mlts")
```

To install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/),
you need to install the `rstan`-package first and configure your R
installation to be able to compile C++ code. You can find instructions
for both steps on the [RStan
GitHub](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started).
Afterwards, you can install the development version of `mlts` with

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("munchfab/mlts")
```

## A Simple Example

``` r
# load package
library(mlts)
```

One of the simplest models we can fit with `mlts` is a multilevel first
order autoregressive model with only one observed variable. We start by
specifying the model with `mlts_model()`. The argument `q` controls the
number of time-series constructs. For this simple model, the following
call is sufficient:

``` r
# build a simple autoregressive model
ar1_model <- mlts_model(q = 1)
```

We can check the parameters present in the model by just calling the
object:

``` r
ar1_model
#>        Model   Level             Type                   Param

#> 2 Structural  Within     Fixed effect               phi(1)_11
#> 3 Structural  Within     Fixed effect             ln.sigma2_1
#> 4 Structural Between Random effect SD              sigma_mu_1

#> 7 Structural Between   RE correlation        r_mu_1.phi(1)_11
#> 8 Structural Between   RE correlation      r_mu_1.ln.sigma2_1

#> 8                  RE Cor        0        LKJ              1          NA
#> 9                  RE Cor        0        LKJ              1          NA
```

When `mlts_model()` sets up this model, all model parameters are free
(i.e., not constrained) by default. On the within level, there are three
fixed effects: the grand mean (`mu_1`) of the outcome, the
autoregressive effect (`phi(1)_11`), and the natural log of the
innovation variance (`ln.sigma2_1`). The `(1)` in brackets for the
autoregressive effect parameter indicates a lag of first order, and the
`_11` subscript denotes that the first construct is as well predicted by
the first construct. Note that for the innovation variance, the natural
log is used to prevent the variance from dropping below zero. For each
of these effects, random effects are also estimated on the between
level, which are drawn from a multivariate normal distribution with zero
mean. Standard deviations of random effects are indicated with a
`sigma_` prefix, and random effect correlations are indicated with an
`r_` prefix.

A TeX formula for the above model can be obtained by calling the
`mlts_model_formula()` function on the model object. By default, the
function produces an RMarkdown file and renders it to a pdf file using
`knitr`. However, the TeX file can also be kept by calling
`keep_tex = TRUE` within the function call.

``` r
mlts_model_formula(ar1_model)
```

\text{with}~\zeta_{1,it} \sim \mathit{N}(0, \sigma^2_{\zeta_{1},i})  \end{gathered}
$$

\gamma_{0,\phi_{(1)11}}\\
\gamma_{0,\ln(\sigma^2_{\zeta_{1}})}\\ \end{bmatrix} +
  \begin{bmatrix} \upsilon_{\mu_{1},i}\\
\upsilon_{\phi_{(1)11},i}\\
\upsilon_{\ln(\sigma^2_{\zeta_{1}}),i}\\ \end{bmatrix} ,\\ 
\text{with}~
  \upsilon_{i} \sim \mathit{MVN}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{\Omega})  \end{gathered}
$$

Furthermore, a path model can also be produced with the function
`mlts_model_paths()`. Again, the function produces an RMarkdown and pdf
file by default. A png file for each level can also be produced by
calling `add_png = TRUE` and the TeX code for the path model can be kept
with `keep_tex = TRUE`.

``` r
mlts_model_paths(ar1_model)
```

<img src="vignettes/pathmodel_ar1.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

To fit the above model, we pass it together with the data set to
`mlts_fit()`. The data set for this example is an artificial data set
simulated from an autoregressive model:

``` r
head(ar1_data)
#>   ID time    Y1
#> 1  1    1  1.16
#> 2  1    2 -0.29
#> 3  1    3  0.40
#> 4  1    4 -0.18
#> 5  1    5 -0.66
#> 6  1    6  0.42
```

We need to specify the variable in `data` that contains the time-series
process in the `ts` argument and the variable that contains the unit
identifier in the `id` argument. With the argument `tinterval`, the time
interval for approximation of a continuous time process can be specified
Asparouhov et al. (2018). We donâ€™t specify it here, but see the Vignette
*Approximation of a Continuous Time Model* for more details.

``` r
ar1_fit <- mlts_fit(
  model = ar1_model,
  data = ar1_data,
  id = "ID",
  ts = "Y1",
  iter = 4000
)
```

The model `summary()` shows general information about the model and
data:

``` r

The line
`Time series variables as indicated by parameter subscripts: 1 --> Y1`
shows that model parameters indexed by a `_1` refer to the variable `Y1`
in the data set. The `Model convergence criteria` provide an overview
across convergence diagnostics for all model parameters (i.e., also
parameters which are not printed in the `summary()` by default). For the
simple AR1-model, all parameters converged well after 4,000 iterations.

The section `Fixed Effects` provides information about the fixed effects
in the model, i.e., $\gamma_{0, \mu_1}$, $\gamma_{0, \phi_{(1)11}}$, and
$\gamma_{0,\ln(\sigma^2_{\zeta_{1}})}$ in the above formula. For
example, the posterior mean of the autoregressive effect parameter
`phi(1)_11` is estimated at .275 with 95%-credible interval \[.218,
.331\]. The log variance of the innovations $\zeta_{1t}$ is estimated at
-.304. The estimate needs to be exponentiated to be on the original
scale: exp(-.304) = 0.738.

The section `Random Effects SDs` shows standard deviations of the random
effects $\upsilon_{\mu_{1},i}$, $\upsilon_{\phi_{(1)11},i}$, and
$\upsilon_{\ln(\sigma^2_{\zeta_{1}}),i}$. The section
`Random Effects Correlations` shows correlations between random effects.
For example, while random effects of the person mean
$\upsilon_{\mu_{1},i}$ and the autoregressive effect
$\upsilon_{\phi_{(1)11},i}$ display nearly no correlation, 0.017, there
is a positive correlation between the person mean and log innovation
variance, 0.217. This indicates that individuals with a higher person
mean in the variable `Y1` also tend to have a higher innovation
variance.

The parameter estimates can also be plotted with the
`mtls_plot()`-function. By default, forest plots of model parameters are
produced. The `what`-argument controls what parameter types are plotted
(e.g., fixed effects, random effect standard deviations, and other).

``` r
mlts_plot(ar1_fit, type = "fe", what = "Fixed effect")
```
