\title{Add measurement model structure to a \code{VARmodel}-object}
\usage{
mlts_model_measurement(VARmodel, q, p, btw.factor = TRUE, btw.model = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{VARmodel}{data.frame. Output of VARmodel-Functions.}

\item{q}{integer. The number of time-varying constructs.}

\item{p}{integer. A vector of length \code{q} with the number of manifest
indicators per construct.}

\item{btw.factor}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (the default), a common between-level factor
is modeled across all indicator variables. If \code{FALSE}, instead of a between-level
factor, indicator mean levels will be included as individual (random) effects stemming
from a joint multivariate normal distribution.}

\item{btw.model}{A list to indicate for which manifest indicator variables a common
between-level factor should be modeled (see Details for detailed instructions).
At this point restricted to one factor per latent construct.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{data.frame}.
}
\description{
Add (or replace) a measurement model of an existing \code{VARmodel}-object. As default
option, a multiple-indicator model will be included assuming a common between-level factor.
}
\details{
Update a \code{VARmodel}-object.
}
\examples{
# build a manifest two-level AR(1) model
VARmodel <- mlts_model(q = 1)

# add measurement model using three indicators
VARmodel <- mlts_model_measurement(VARmodel, q = 1, p = 3, btw.factor = TRUE)

# only indicator-specific (random) intercepts are modeled
VARmodel <- mlts_model_measurement(VARmodel, q = 1, p = 3, btw.factor = TRUE)

# A more fine-grained between-level measurement model can be specified via:
VARmodel <- mlts_model_measurement(
              VARmodel, q = 1, p = 3,
              btw.model = list(""))
# Which models a common latent factor on the between-level for the first three
# indicators and a random indicator mean for the fourth indicator.
